title: Speed up Github connection
---

<p>
  I live in Singapore. This is the standard time a <code>git pull</code> takes:
  <pre><code>
$ time git pull
Already up-to-date.

real  0m5.272s
user  0m0.045s
sys 0m0.037s
  </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  It's a bit annoying to wait so much every single time git needs to access the github remote.
  To solve that, it's possible to keep a ssh connection open with github and use it instead of opening a new one every time.
</p>

<p>
  To do so, add the following lines to your <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file:
  <pre><code>
Host github.com
  TCPKeepAlive yes
  ServerAliveInterval 60
  ControlMaster auto
  ControlPath ~/.ssh/connection-%r@%h:%p
  </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  After that, to keep a connection open with github run the following command and send it to the background:
  <pre><code>
ssh -fN git@github.com
  </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  When this is running, this is the new time for a git pull:
  <pre><code>
$ time git pull
Already up-to-date.

real  0m1.593s
user  0m0.032s
sys 0m0.033s
  </code></pre>
</p>
