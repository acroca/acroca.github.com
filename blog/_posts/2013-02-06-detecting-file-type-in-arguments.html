title: Detecting File type in arguments
---
<p>
  The other day I needed a method that, based on a file sent in one of the arguments, uploads that file to S3 and returns its URL.
</p>

<p>
  Initially I started with somehting like 
  <pre><code data-language='ruby'>
def upload(file)
  if file.is_a?(IO)
    content = file.read
    # ...
  end
end
  </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  Since a <code data-language='ruby'>File</code> is a subclass of <code data-language='ruby'>IO</code>, that should work, but it didn't.
</p>

<p>
  The problem was that the file is not directly a <code data-language='ruby'>File</code>, it's an uploaded file to Rails, and them seem to be a <code data-language='ruby'>Tempfile</code>. And it happens that <code data-language='ruby'>Tempfile</code> is not a <code data-language='ruby'>File</code>, so it's not an <code data-language='ruby'>IO</code>.
</p>

<p>
  So I had to extend the code to detect also <code data-language='ruby'>Tempfile</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Not very happy with that, still didn't work.
</p>

<p>
  The problem now is that Rails file parameters are instances of a wrapper class with the file in one of the attributes. I didn't want to add another <code data-language='ruby'>if</code> for this new instance type, so I changed the code for
  <pre><code data-language='ruby'>
def upload(file)
  if file.responds_to?(:read)
    content = file.read
    # ...
  end
end
  </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  I don't really like this, but it is something all the classes have in common.
</p>

<p>
  Does anyone encounter this issue before? Am I missing something here?
