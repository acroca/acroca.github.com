title: About side projects and people
---

<p>
  I know there's a lot of posts regarding side projects (or pet projects). Here my five cents.
</p>

<p>
  I always have some ideas in my mind that comes back from time to time. If they come back when I feel motivated to work on it, I do it. Usually that ideas are medium-size projects, thing that I can't avoid (the idea comes as it comes).
</p>

<p>
  After working on any medium-sized side project for some time I always fall into one of the following situations:

  <ol>
    <li>The first phase is feature complete and it's time to get users. The project dies here.</li>
    <li>The first phase is feature complete and it's time to get users. I continue adding features until I realize I need users. <code>goto 1</code></li>
    <li>The project takes too long (it's too big) and it's not fun anymore. I pause the project and I start again in some months. Not very effective/productive workflow.</li>
    <li>The features why I chose that project are done and probably it's time to do UI. The project dies here because I don't like doing UI</li>
  </ol>
</p>

<p>
  Another problem for medium-size projects is the people involved. Usually I do the side projects alone and I find hard to keep motivated or keep the focus. I think it happens because a project is not always fun and the whole point of a side project is to have fun.

  This week I've decided to bring back a side project I was doing some time ago. It is called <a href="https://github.com/acroca/spinoff">SpinOff</a> and it's a online game where the player manages a TV Channel buying content to play, showing ads, etc. I rewrote it around 7 months ago to be API + backbone but stop working on that after a while.
</p>

<p>
  The reason why I want to revive it again is because it's a project I really like and I don't want to let it die without finishing it and see it live. It's a game I'd love to play.<br/>
  The reason why I stopped working on it is because I had to do too much UI and I don't enjoy it at all, I never find the right time to do it because it's never fun to me.
</p>

<p>
  Because of that, I decided to find more people and build a small team to work on it. Since I can do all the API backend, one more coder doing the UI should be enough, for any platform (Android, iOS, web or Facebook). A team of three would be even better to share ideas and have more client apps.
