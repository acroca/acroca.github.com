title: Redis pipelined queries
---
<p>
  A few days ago I discovered a <em>feature</em> in the <a href='https://github.com/ezmobius/redis-rb'>redis gem</a> that is called <code data-language='ruby'>pipeline</code>.
</p>

<p>
  In the code for this post I'll use <code data-language='ruby'>REDIS</code> as your redis connection. I use that because in most of the rails projects I've seen it's like that.
</p>

<h2>Standard way</h2>

<p>
  Given a connection, you can perform a set of quieries like that:
  <pre><code data-language='ruby'>
5000.times do
  REDIS.lpush "test_#{rand(100)}", "hello world"
end
# About 3.3 seconds in heroku with redistogo
  </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  This pushes 5000 times the value <code data-language='ruby'>"hello world"</code> to a random key from <code data-language='ruby'>test_0</code> to <code data-language='ruby'>test_99</code> in the redis database. It can be improved doing only one mass-push fo each key, but even that you will run 100 queries.
</p>

<p>
  If your redis database is remote, it will connect with the database 5000 times (or 100 with mass push), which will take some time just to perform the connection remotelly.
</p>

<h2>Pipelined way</h2>

<p>
  To solve that problem, the redis gem have pipelined queries. Let's see the same code but pipelined:

  <pre><code>
REDIS.pipelined do
  5000.times do
    REDIS.lpush &quot;test_#{rand(100)}&quot;, &quot;hello world&quot;
  end
end
# About 0.1 seconds in heroku with redistogo
  </code></pre>
</p>

<p>
  This looks the same, right? Well, internally <code data-language='ruby'>REDIS</code> is not performing the query at all, it's just saving the commands to an array. When the pipelined block is closed, it performs all the queued commands in one single connection.
</p>

<h2>What can't be done using pipelines</h2>

<p>
  It sounds perfect but, like everything, has some <em>cons</em>. In a pipelined block you can't get the response of anything in redis because the request it's not performed when you call it.
</p>

<p>
  In the following example we can't use pipelines:

  <pre><code>
5000.times do |i|
  value = REDIS.get(&quot;test_#{i}&quot;)
  REDIS.lpush(&quot;all&quot;, value)
end
  </code></pre>
</p>


<p>
  The <code data-language='ruby'>REDIS.get</code> within a pipeline doesn't return the value, so we can't wrap inside pipelines anything that performs operations to get data and do something based on that data.
